      period: "University Years (2014-2018)",
      challenge: "I started as an unconfident student who found coding completely overwhelming. Traditional programming courses felt abstract and disconnected from anything meaningful.",
      breakthrough: "Everything changed when I discovered game development. Suddenly, code wasn't just syntax ‚Äî it was creating worlds, characters, and interactive experiences that people could actually enjoy.",

            <p>
              <strong>Confidence comes from doing, not knowing everything upfront.</strong> That Apple
              internship taught me that I didn&apos;t need to be the smartest person in the room ‚Äî I just
              needed to be willing to figure things out and make them work.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Government work teaches you what &apos;scale&apos; really means.</strong> When thousands
              of people depend on your code working perfectly, you learn to think differently about
              testing, edge cases, and the responsibility that comes with shipping software.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Being in small teams teaches you to wear many hats.</strong> At GovRewards,
              sitting in pitch meetings and influencing product roadmaps taught me that great developers
              also need to understand business context and user needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Career breaks are underrated.</strong> Stepping away gave me space to explore
              what I actually want to build, not just what I&apos;m assigned to build. Sometimes the best
              career move is taking time to remember why you started coding in the first place.

              <strong>Learning never stops, but now it&apos;s fun.</strong> Whether it&apos;s Spanish, photography,
              or the latest AI models ‚Äî I&apos;ve learned that curiosity is a superpower, and the skills
              you pick up &apos;for fun&apos; often become your biggest advantages.
